# Ansible desktop ricer

Having a beautiful linux setup?

Already shared your dotfiles repo at r/unixporn?

Think that would be forever?

What if your laptop blows up tomorrow or you just want to switch hardware? 

Setting up everything again with HANDS! meh...

**This project is a solution!** Just set up Ansible, and make it do everything
for you

## How to make it work

1. Make sure you have Ansible installed
```bash
$ sudo apt install ansible
# or
$ sudo pacman -S ansible
# or
$ pip install ansible
#or
$ pip3 install ansible
```

2. Run **ONE** command
```bash
$ ansible-pull -U <url>
```
